# Python-Assignment-Week-7
# Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

## Description

This project demonstrates how to load, analyze and visualize a dataset using Python's `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries. The Iris dataset is used as an example but the workflow can be applied to any tabular dataset.

---

## Objectives

- Load and explore a dataset using pandas.
- Perform basic data analysis and compute statistics.
- Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn.
- Summarize findings and observations.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

- Load the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`.
- Convert the data to a pandas DataFrame.
- Display the first few rows with `.head()`.
- Check data types and missing values.
- Clean the dataset if necessary.

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

- Compute basic statistics using `.describe()`.
- Group by the `species` column and compute mean values.
- Identify patterns or interesting findings.

### Task 3: Data Visualization

Create at least four visualizations:
1. **Line Chart:** Trend of sorted sepal length.
2. **Bar Chart:** Average petal length per species.
3. **Histogram:** Distribution of sepal width.
4. **Scatter Plot:** Sepal length vs. petal length, colored by species.

All plots are customized with titles, axis labels and legends.

---

## Usage

Run the analysis script:
```
python iris_analysis.py
```
The script will print data summaries and display the plots.

---

## Observations

- Virginica flowers tend to have longer petals.
- There is a positive relationship between sepal length and petal length.
- Setosa species have smaller petal lengths but wider sepals compared to others.

---

## Notes

- You can use your own CSV dataset by modifying the data loading section.
- For more advanced visualizations, explore additional seaborn features.
- Error handling is included in the data loading section using a try-except block to catch and report issues (e.g. file not found, missing data).

---

## Submission

Submit your `.py` or `.ipynb` file containing:
- Data loading and exploration steps
- Basic analysis results
- Visualizations
- Findings or observations

Make sure all plots are labeled and provide insights into the dataset.
